## Description
J.A.T.E. — Just Another Text Editor — is a single-page Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that functions in the browser. It features data persistence techniques, functions offline, and can be downloaded as a PWA. It utilizes a number of technologies including IndexedDB, workbox, and webpack. Not only are assets pre-cached, but service workers are registered to cache assets and their code in the text editor is saved across sessions.
